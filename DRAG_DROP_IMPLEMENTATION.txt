DRAG AND DROP IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
===================================

Overview:
---------
This implementation adds drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks from the "This Week's Focus" 
section to the "Today's 3 Critical Tasks" section.

Files Modified:
---------------
1. App.tsx - Main application component
2. components/WeeklyFocus.tsx - Weekly tasks component (drag source)
3. components/TodayTasks.tsx - Today's tasks component (drop target)

How It Works:
-------------

1. DRAG SOURCE (WeeklyFocus.tsx):
   - Each task item is now draggable (draggable={true})
   - Visual feedback: Task becomes semi-transparent while dragging
   - Task data is serialized to JSON and attached to the drag event
   - Cursor changes to "move" to indicate draggable items

2. DROP TARGET (TodayTasks.tsx):
   - The entire card accepts dropped tasks
   - Visual feedback: Blue ring and background highlight when dragging over
   - Shows "Drop task here" message during drag-over
   - Processes the dropped task data and triggers the move event

3. STATE MANAGEMENT (App.tsx):
   - weekTasks state now managed in App component (previously static)
   - handleMoveWeekTaskToToday function converts WeekTask to Task format
   - Custom window event 'moveWeekTaskToToday' bridges components
   - Task is added to today's list and removed from week's list atomically

Key Features:
-------------
- Native HTML5 drag-and-drop API (no external dependencies)
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Automatic task conversion (WeekTask → Task)
- Maintains client and phase information
- Tasks are removed from week list after successful drop
- Smooth animations and transitions

User Experience:
----------------
1. Hover over any task in "This Week's Focus" - cursor changes to move icon
2. Click and drag the task
3. Task becomes semi-transparent while dragging
4. Drag over "Today's 3 Critical Tasks" section
5. Section highlights with blue border and shows drop zone message
6. Release mouse to drop
7. Task appears in today's list and disappears from week's list

Technical Details:
------------------
- Uses React synthetic events for drag operations
- Data transfer via JSON serialization
- Custom event system for cross-component communication
- TypeScript type safety maintained throughout
- Preserves all task metadata (client, phase, title)
- Generates unique IDs for converted tasks using timestamp

Future Enhancements:
--------------------
- Add drag-and-drop from Today back to Week
- Add drag-and-drop to Month Milestones
- Add keyboard accessibility (arrow keys + space/enter)
- Add touch support for mobile devices
- Add undo functionality
- Add animation when task moves between lists
- Persist changes to backend/database
